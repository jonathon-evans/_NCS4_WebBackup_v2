<p><span>The </span><span><strong>National Sport Se</strong><strong>curity Laboratory (NSSL)</strong></span><span>
        exposes practitioners, researchers, and students to a fully outfitted research, training, and operation center
        with integrated safety and security technologies. The NSSL derives its unique position through its connectivity
        to each of the university's three main sports facilities. The M.M. Roberts Stadium (football), Reed Green
        Coliseum (basketball), and Pete Taylor Baseball Park (baseball) serve as technology, training, and exercising
        extensions of the lab. The university applies sport safety and security best practices in an environment
        uniquely designed to integrate people, processes, and technology. Students, practitioners, and solution
        providers can explore the problems of today and effort to solve the problems of tomorrow.</span><span></span>
</p>
<p><span>The NSSL is an operational multiagency coordination center, designed to provide an optimal environment for
        research, validation, training and operations. A complete list of integrated hardware is available <a

    </span></p>
<p><span>The state-of-the-art audio/visual system allows users to seamlessly coordinate, display, and disseminate
        information. Lab tested technologies are made available for training, operations, and experimentation.
        Practitioners can explore and train with capable solutions, while students can build an understanding of the
        role technologies play in safety and security.</span></p>
