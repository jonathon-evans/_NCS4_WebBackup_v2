<p>The National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security (NCS4) is established at The University of Southern
  Mississippi (USM) and is the world’s leading academic research institution in addressing sports safety and security
  risks and threats. NCS4 is partially underwritten by grants from the United States Department of Homeland Security and
  functions with the ambitious mission of conducting innovative research, provide training, enhance professional
  development, and assess security solutions to support the advancement of safety and security throughout the world.</p>
<p>The research and educational mission of NCS4 is accomplished by working in close partnership with industry
  professionals, researchers and academics, and national and international government agencies to develop and deploy
  practical performance improvement tools and applications that bolster the capacity of practitioners to respond
  effectively to the current and future safety and security challenges and issues.</p>

  <div class="open-target">
    <p>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, the United States Department of Homeland Security identified sport venues as
      potential soft targets for terrorism. In 2006, USM established NCS4 in response to the United States’ emerging
      security needs. Today, NCS4 is the nation’s only research center devoted to the study and practice of spectator
      sports safety and security. It is a cornerstone in the scholarship arena as it represents USM’s innovative
      approach to research, training, and development.</p>

            <p>The idea for NCS4 emerged from a 2006 doctoral dissertation about the standards required for effective
              security management at university sport venues. Building upon this fundamental research, NCS4 is now an
              international research and education center for sports safety and security. NCS4 collaborates with
              professional sport leagues and venues, intercollegiate and interscholastic athletics, marathon and
              endurance events, and international sporting events along with professional associations, private sector
              firms, and government agencies. Its partnerships bring together subject matter experts from government,
              industry, public safety, private enterprise, and academia to explore lessons learned and share ideas about
              best practices, strategies, training and certifications, and technology solutions for sport safety and
              security challenges.</p>
