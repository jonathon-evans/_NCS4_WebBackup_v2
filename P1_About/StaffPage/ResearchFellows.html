                which includes providing leadership and oversight in the development of best practices and related educational

                articles and conference papers on various aspects of sport safety and security from across the world.
                <br /><br /> Prior to his current position at NCS4, Justin was a Senior Lecturer (US equivalent of Associate
                Professor) for the Institute of Security and Crime Science at the University of Waikato (New Zealand). There he
                taught several foundational graduate level courses on security, crime science, and prevention, in addition to
                serving as a principal investigator on numerous security related grants. Before taking his position as a Senior
                Lecturer, Justin was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Rutgers University’s School of Criminal Justice, where he
                conducted research with Stockholm Prize Winner (Criminology’s Nobel Prize) and the Associate Director of the
                Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, Professor Ronald V. Clarke, focusing primarily on aspects of
                spatiotemporal crime pattern analysis and situational prevention and a range of topics including the
                effectiveness of barriers in preventing suicide bombings in Israel.<br /><br /> Justin has a PhD in Security and
                Crime Science from University College London. His dissertation entitled “The Ecology of Football-Related Crime
                and Disorder” explored how variation in the environment of the area around stadia when they were used for soccer
                games as opposed to days in which these facilities were not used facilitated different criminal opportunities
                and risk. This was achieved through the analysis of various datasets, including, but not limited to
                police-recorded crime data, attendance figures from games, and numerous aspects of the physical and social
                landscape around these stadia such as the street network and constellation of facilities such as pubs that are
                routinely visited during game days. Justin received a studentship (US equivalent to a full scholarship plus a
                living stipend) from related research he conducted for the Government Office for London (GoL), the Association
                of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU), and the Scottish Government to fully
                fund his doctoral studies. He also holds a Master’s degree in Criminal Justice from Boston University and a
                Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Rutgers University. </span>
