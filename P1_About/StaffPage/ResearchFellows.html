        NCS4’s initiative to improve the safety and security of High School Interscholastic Athletics across the nation,
        which includes providing leadership and oversight in the development of best practices and related educational
        trainings. Justin also oversees NCS4’s research fellows who provide expertise and generate peer-reviewed journal
        articles and conference papers on various aspects of sport safety and security from across the world.
        <br /><br /> Prior to his current position at NCS4, Justin was a Senior Lecturer (US equivalent of Associate
        Professor) for the Institute of Security and Crime Science at the University of Waikato (New Zealand). There he
        taught several foundational graduate level courses on security, crime science, and prevention, in addition to
        serving as a principal investigator on numerous security related grants. Before taking his position as a Senior
        Lecturer, Justin was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Rutgers University’s School of Criminal Justice, where he
        conducted research with Stockholm Prize Winner (Criminology’s Nobel Prize) and the Associate Director of the
        Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, Professor Ronald V. Clarke, focusing primarily on aspects of
        spatiotemporal crime pattern analysis and situational prevention and a range of topics including the
        effectiveness of barriers in preventing suicide bombings in Israel.<br /><br /> Justin has a PhD in Security and
        Crime Science from University College London. His dissertation entitled “The Ecology of Football-Related Crime
        and Disorder” explored how variation in the environment of the area around stadia when they were used for soccer
        games as opposed to days in which these facilities were not used facilitated different criminal opportunities
        and risk. This was achieved through the analysis of various datasets, including, but not limited to
        police-recorded crime data, attendance figures from games, and numerous aspects of the physical and social
        landscape around these stadia such as the street network and constellation of facilities such as pubs that are
        routinely visited during game days. Justin received a studentship (US equivalent to a full scholarship plus a
        living stipend) from related research he conducted for the Government Office for London (GoL), the Association
        of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU), and the Scottish Government to fully
