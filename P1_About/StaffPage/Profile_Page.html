        entertainment, safety and security.<br /><br />Furthermore, NCS4 is dedicated to the education of future leaders
        through research and scholarship, advancing professional competencies, training today’s first responders, and
        advancing technology to solve current and future safety and security concerns.<br /><br />Under his leadership,
        NCS4 has become a highly respected national and international academic leader in the sports and entertainment
        and school safety and security industry. His vision and keen insight has created a global center that serves
        academic research and scholarship, education, training, industry best practices, and innovative advancement in
        technology and professional development.<br /><br />Prior to establishing the NCS4, Dr. Marciani served in
        academic roles in sports management, serving as a program director. He taught courses in risk management,
        marketing, and leadership, and has published textbooks, peer-reviewed research articles, and other academic and

        grants from homeland security, and helped secure more than $10 million in Department of Defense and industry
        grants for USM and NCS4.<br /><br />Dr. Marciani has expanded USM and NCS4’s global reach by establishing a
        formal relationship with INTERPOL and its Project STADIA program. Established by INTERPOL in 2012, Project
        Stadia is a 10-year project to build police capacity for managing international sporting
        events.<br /><br />INTERPOL Project STADIA selected NCS4 to serve as a research and academic pathfinder to help
        create police capacity building programs in sports safety and security for INTERPOL’s 194 member
        nations.<br /><br />Under Dr. Marciani’s leadership, NCS4 has developed a curriculum to teach police commanders
        and incident management leaders around the world how to deal with safety and security challenges they face when
        hosting a major international sporting event. NCS4 has the distinction of creating the first course ever
        accredited by INTERPOL. NCS4 has taught 131 police commanders from 58 nations since 2017. As of Sept. 2019, NCS4
        will complete training the initial cadre of 23 Qatari police commanders for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Doha,
        Qatar. NCS4 will continue its training mission in Qatar in 2020.<br /><br />Dr. Marciani recruited Fortune 500
        global technology corporations to create a Technology Alliance, whose mission is to be the driving force for
        identifying innovative safety and security solutions. The Technology Alliance members are sponsoring research in
        safety and security technologies that will transform sports and entertainment venues and schools well beyond
        2025.<br /><br />Prior to his academic role, Dr. Marciani had extensive experience in managing several
        intercollegiate athletic programs and serving the United States Olympic Committee. His sports management
        experience provides real insight into addressing the issues posed by potential and actual threats and risks to

        and colleges in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and China. He is a co-author of the first academic
        sports security textbook designed for graduate curriculum.<br /><br />Dr. Marciani received his doctorate degree

        manages NCS4’s initiative to improve the safety and security of High School Interscholastic Athletics across the
        nation, which includes providing leadership and oversight in the development of best practices and related
        educational trainings. Dr. Kurland also oversees NCS4’s research fellows who provide expertise and generate
        peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers on various aspects of sport safety and security from across
        the world.<br /><br />Prior to his current position at NCS4, Dr. Kurland was a Senior Lecturer (US equivalent of
        Associate Professor) for the Institute of Security and Crime Science at the University of Waikato (New Zealand).
        There he taught several foundational graduate level courses on security, crime science, and prevention, in
        addition to serving as a principal investigator on numerous security related grants. Before taking his position
        as a Senior Lecturer, Dr. Kurland was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Rutgers University’s School of Criminal Justice,
        where he conducted research with Stockholm Prize Winner (Criminology’s Nobel Prize) and the Associate Director
        of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, Professor Ronald V. Clarke, focusing primarily on aspects of
        spatiotemporal crime pattern analysis and situational prevention and a range of topics including the
        effectiveness of barriers in preventing suicide bombings in Israel.<br /><br />Dr. Kurland has a Ph.D. in
        Security and Crime Science from University College London. His dissertation entitled “The Ecology of
        Football-Related Crime and Disorder” explored how variation in the environment of the area around stadia when
        they were used for soccer games as opposed to days in which these facilities were not used facilitated different
        criminal opportunities and risk. This was achieved through the analysis of various datasets, including, but not
        limited to police-recorded crime data, attendance figures from games, and numerous aspects of the physical and
        social landscape around these stadia such as the street network and constellation of facilities such as pubs
        that are routinely visited during game days. Dr. Kurland received a studentship (US equivalent to a full
        scholarship plus a living stipend) from related research he conducted for the Government Office for London
        (GoL), the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU), and the Scottish
        Government to fully fund his doctoral studies. He also holds a Master’s degree in Criminal Justice from Boston
        University and a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Rutgers University.</span>
