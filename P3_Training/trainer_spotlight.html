        <p>Mark began his career in Emergency Management in 2000, where he worked for Ada City-County Emergency
            Management, Boise, Idaho, as Exercise and Training Coordinator. Robertson was also a Regional Coordinator
            for the Idaho Department of Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program and facilitator and evaluator
            for exercises held at the National Interagency Fire Center.<br /><br />Mark was the State of Nebraska
            National Incident Management System (NIMS) Coordinator and Exercise Training Officer for the Nebraska
            Emergency Management Agency and worked with Nebraska Office of the Chief Information Officer as Disaster and
            Continuity of Operations Coordinator.<br /><br />Currently, Mark is the Emergency Management Coordinator for
            the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. This season will be his eighteenth as the Planning Section Chief of
            the Incident Management Team for Nebraska football games, which sees regular attendance at 90,000 people,
            with the longest sellout streak in the nation (since 1962).<br /><br />Mark admits to being an Incident
            Command System (ICS) nerd and beginning his career as a member of the media but asks to not hold that
            against him. Presently, Mark instructs three courses for NCS4 and has been a key member of the training team
            since beginning approximately two years ago.</p>

                    What has been the greatest professional benefit to instructing with NCS4?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The saying goes “if you want to really learn something – teach it”. This has been tremendously true
                    for me, I learn from presenting the materials, but learn more from the students that attend the
                    courses and share their experiences and best practices.

                    What is your most memorable location or experience from a delivery?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first course I instructed was in the Golden Nugget Casino in Atlantic City (because, why not?) I
                    stayed at there at the Casino and the first morning, in the elevator on the way to class, a gambler
                    couple wished me good luck… I remember thinking, “I am going to need it!”

                    What is one takeaway from any NCS4 course you wish you knew as a young professional?
                </p>
                <p>
                    From all of the courses: “it is not who is in charge, but who is in charge of what”. Big events
                    require a great deal of coordination and planning from all stakeholders. The better stakeholders
                    work together to define roles and responsibilities, in the planning phase, the better prepared
                    everyone is for the event and potential incidents. The courses simulate the coordination that occurs
                    when stakeholders work together.

                <p style=" font-weight: bold;">
                    Why do you feel these courses are important to the security industry and the nation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The courses are an ideal way for stakeholders to determine best practices for their individual
                    jurisdictions and the events held in their cities. The material is applicable to all events whether
                    it is a small county fair or a nationally televised sporting event. The exercises in the courses lay
                    the foundation for improvement of event management and response.

            “The experience of working with NCS4 has been remarkably valuable. I learn from the co-instructors and the
            students. I am able to bring back creative solutions to deal with areas that need improvement. I encourage
            anyone involved with sports management or response to consider attending. I am certain you will find the
            experience to be worthwhile.” – Mark Roberston
