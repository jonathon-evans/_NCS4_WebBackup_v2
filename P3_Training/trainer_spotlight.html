                    I love making the best better! Working for the Dallas Cowboys, that was a part of the culture I
                    loved. I
                    truly believe no matter how amazing you are, how great your system is, or how many times you have
                    hosted
                    that exact same event, you can ALWAYS do better! No single person knows everything... learning and
                    improving is what pushes us forward and makes us stronger, more prepared, and more successful with
                    our
                    events. At the end of the day, I want to make sure the people that come to your event, no matter how
                    big
                    or small your attendance number is, every single one of those people need to make it back home
                    safely
                    from your event. I don’t want anyone to look back and say I wish I had done more…I’m here to help
                    them
                    do just a little bit more.

                    What has been the greatest professional benefit to instructing with NCS4?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relationships and knowledge I have personally gained are huge benefits. Not only do I enjoy
                    teaching
                    these courses, but I enjoy constantly learning from the students’ experiences that are discussed in
                    every course – their tips, tricks, best practices, and even failures. I am becoming a better
                    instructor
                    and industry professional with every single class because of the people that attend the courses and
                    share their experiences.

                    What is your most memorable location or experience from a delivery?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two experiences that stand out because they are similar. We had the windows open in the
                    classroom in Santa Rosa, California and while I was leading the class in a discussion suddenly, I
                    was
                    interrupted by a strange noise… Gobble-gobble!! There were 5 turkeys gobbling right outside those
                    windows in the parking lot! Apparently, turkeys roaming around the city was normal to the locals but
                    a
                    unique experience for me! Similarly, I was instructing in Anchorage, Alaska and we took a break
                    between
                    modules; the class opened one of the outside venue doors and immediately yelled for me to come over.
                    Soon as I did, they opened the door to show me a huge moose standing not 3 feet from the door!! For
                    them, this was not unusual, for me… I was amazed!

                    What is one takeaway from any NCS4 course you wish you knew as a young professional?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish I had known this training was available!! I had no idea there were so many courses that I
                    could
                    take for free that would have greatly helped me in my early years in this industry. When I first
                    attended an NCS4 course I was impressed at all the relevant information I was receiving and was
                    slightly
                    upset no one had told me about these courses sooner!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style=" font-weight: bold;">
                    Why do you feel these courses are important to the security industry and the nation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s a statement in one of the videos of these courses that says, “What if the worse thing
                    happened
                    in your venue today, what will you have wished you would have done? That’s what you must be doing
                    now.
                    Because how do you know today isn’t the worst day?” Since the first time I heard that phrase, it has
                    stuck with me. It is exactly why everyone that puts on any type or size of event needs to take these
                    courses. There is no 100% safe venue; the threat is real and present anywhere, anytime. Life safety
                    must
                    always be the number one priority and these courses help to prepare and prevent those incidents.

            "Tangible takeaways are always my goal with a class; I want every class member to leave the course with
            something
            they can confidently take back to their organization and start implementing. These courses give them the
            opportunity to learn new ideas, look at situations differently, and communicate more effectively with their
            event partners. Participating in these courses is an invaluable part of making an organization’s events
            better
            and safer." - Amanda Wright
